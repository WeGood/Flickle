Flickle is going to be my alternative to Flickr. It's going to be a simple full screen photo viewer.

The aim is to be able to run this rails app anywhere, link it to your Dropbox and then import any photos you drop in the Flickle app folder.

I've had a couple of evenings on this so far and have got all the basics pretty much working - Dropbox API importing images, fullscreen images (thanks to [https://github.com/akv2/MaxImage](https://github.com/akv2/MaxImage)) etc. I'll probably make a couple more improvements, write a blog post on [my blog](http://www.lesstalkymoreshippy.com) and that'll be it for the time being.

This isn't really ready for public use.
